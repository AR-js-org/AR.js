You can now own the first commit of AR.js! üëâ[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0xe7ea2e2be12c257d376400cb231d8ee51e972bd6/3962549295964122998537137060348053157629730105441540397501924171148500367064/)

AR.js is a lightweight library for Augmented Reality on the Web, coming with features like Image Tracking, Location-based AR and Marker tracking.

<i><b>30/12/21 Update:</b> There is now also a brand new OSS Web AR JS library around, called [MindAR](https://github.com/hiukim/mind-ar-js).
If you need a great Image tracking feature (also multiple image tracking) and Face tracking, [go check it out](https://github.com/hiukim/mind-ar-js)!  
  As for now, AR.js is still the only library providing Marker based and Location based AR features.</i>

This project has been created by [@jeromeetienne](https://github.com/jeromeetienne), previously managed by Nicol√≤ Carpignoli and it is now maintained by the AR.js org.

üöÄFor frequent updates on AR.js you can follow [@the official ùïè(Twitter) account](https://twitter.com/ARjs_Library) and Watch this repo!

### ‚ö°Ô∏èAR.js has now an official Documentation!‚ö°Ô∏è
### Check it out: [AR.js Official Documentation](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/).

If you want to give a first look at AR.js potential, you can continue with this Readme.

-----


‚ö°Ô∏è AR.js is coming in different builds. They are both maintained. They are exclusive.

Please import the one you need for your project, not both:

- **AR.js with Image Tracking + Location Based AR (AFRAME):**

  - https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/build/aframe-ar-nft.js

- **AR.js with Marker Tracking + Location Based AR (AFRAME):**

  - https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/build/aframe-ar.js


- **AR.js with Image Tracking + Marker Tracking (Threejs):**

  - https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/three.js/build/ar-threex.js

  if you need the ARjs namespace import ar.js:

  - https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/three.js/build/ar.js

- **AR.js with Location Based AR (Threejs):**

  - https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/three.js/build/ar-threex-location-only.js


You can also import a specific version replacing `master` keyword with version tag:

```html
  <script src="https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/3.4.5/aframe/build/aframe-ar-nft.js">
```

## Get started

### üñº **Image Tracking**

Please follow these simple steps:

- Create a new project with the code below (or [open this live example](https://ar-js-org.github.io/.github/profile/aframe/examples/image-tracking/nft/) and go directly to the last step)
- Run it on a server
- Open the website on your phone
- Scan [this picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/examples/image-tracking/nft/trex-image-big.jpeg) to see content through the camera.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/aframevr/aframe@1.3.0/dist/aframe-master.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/build/aframe-ar-nft.js"></script>

<style>
  .arjs-loader {
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);
    z-index: 9999;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }

  .arjs-loader div {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 1.25em;
    color: white;
  }
</style>

<body style="margin : 0px; overflow: hidden;">
  <!-- minimal loader shown until image descriptors are loaded -->
  <div class="arjs-loader">
    <div>Loading, please wait...</div>
  </div>
  <a-scene
    vr-mode-ui="enabled: false;"
    renderer="logarithmicDepthBuffer: true; precision: medium;"
    embedded
    arjs="trackingMethod: best; sourceType: webcam;debugUIEnabled: false;"
  >
    <!-- we use cors proxy to avoid cross-origin problems ATTENTION! you need to set up your server -->
    <a-nft
      type="nft"
      url="your-server/https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/examples/image-tracking/nft/trex/trex-image/trex"
      smooth="true"
      smoothCount="10"
      smoothTolerance=".01"
      smoothThreshold="5"
    >
      <a-entity
        gltf-model="your-server/https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/examples/image-tracking/nft/trex/scene.gltf"
        scale="5 5 5"
        position="150 300 -100"
      >
      </a-entity>
    </a-nft>
    <a-entity camera></a-entity>
  </a-scene>
</body>
```

### üåçLocation Based Example

Please follow these simple steps:

- Create a new project with the following snippet, and change `add-your-latitude` and `add-your-longitude` with your latitude and longitude, without the `<>`.
- Run it on a server
- Activate GPS on your phone and navigate to the example URL
- Look around. You should see the text looking at you, appearing in the requested position, even if you look around and move.

```

### üî≤ Marker Based Example

Please follow this simple steps:

- Create a new project with the code below (or [open this live example](https://ar-js-org.github.io/.github/profile/aframe/examples/marker-based/basic.html) and go directly to the last step)
- Run it on a server
- Open the website on your phone
- Scan [this picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/data/images/hiro.png) to see content through the camera.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.3.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
    <!-- we import arjs version without NFT but with marker + location based support -->
    <script src="https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/build/aframe-ar.js"></script>
    <body style="margin : 0px; overflow: hidden;">
        <a-scene embedded arjs>
        <a-marker preset="hiro">
            <!-- we use cors proxy to avoid cross-origin problems ATTENTION! you need to set up your server -->
            <a-entity
            position="0 0 0"
            scale="0.05 0.05 0.05"
            gltf-model="your-server/https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/examples/image-tracking/nft/trex/scene.gltf"
            ></a-entity>
        </a-marker>
        <a-entity camera></a-entity>
        </a-scene>
    </body>
</html>
```
Important! Be aware that if you are referring to external resources, in any app, especially those using NFT, you will encounter CORS problems if those resources are not in the same server of the code. If you can‚Äôt see the tracking, please open your Browser Dev Tools and check if you have CORS errors in the console. If so, you have to fix those errors in order to see your content. The correct fix is to place your resources on the same server of your code.

If you cannot do that, you can host a proxy anywhere server to solve that (https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere).
Please note that several hosting services have policies that does not permit to use such server. Always check hosting services policies before using them to avoid account suspensions
