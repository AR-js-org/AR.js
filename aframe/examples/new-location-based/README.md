# Examples for A-Frame `new-location-based` components

- `basic` : Basic example which creates four boxes to the north, south, east and west of your initial GPS position. Allows you to enter a "fake" latitude and longitude for testing on a desktop.

- `poi` : Demonstrates downloading POIs from an OpenStreetMap-based GeoJSON API and adding them to the scene as objects, with text labels.

- `osm-ways` : A more complex example showing how more specialised geodata can be rendered with AR.js. Downloads OpenStreetMap ways (roads, paths) from a GeoJSON API, reprojects them into Spherical Mercator, and adds them to the scene as polylines made up of individual triangles.
