# Location-based examples for classic location-based components

These examples are for the "classic" location-based components, not the `new-location-based` components.

A brief summary of each example follows below. Aside from `hello-world`, the majority of the applications have a simulated lattitude and longitude; please modify the code to use your actual latitude and longitude.

- `always-face-user` - shows how you can use A-Frame's `look-at` component to create an entity which always faces the user.

- `avoid-shaking` - demonstrates the parameters needed to minimise shaking effects. Please look at the source code for full details.

- `click-places` - shows how you can handle click events on places

- `max-min-distance` - how to control the max and min distance you can view an object.

- `peakfinder-2d` - download nearby peaks from an OpenStreetMap-based server (works in Europe and Turkey only) and shows them in AR.
